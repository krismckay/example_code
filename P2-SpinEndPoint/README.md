# Code Example: Problem 2

## Description
Slot Machine Spin Results is our server end point that updates all player data and features when a spin is completed on the client. We do hundreds of millions of these requests per day, and we would like to see you make a very basic MySQL driven version.

## Notes
There are obviously many possibilities for how this could work. For the sake of simplicity I'm using the following assumptions:
* request data is being sent as POST data.
* the player hash is being generated by running MD5 on the salt.
* mysqli is loaded.

## DB Schema
    CREATE TABLE `player` (
      `player_id` int(11) unsigned NOT NULL AUTO_INCREMENT,
      `name` varchar(64),
      `credits` int(11) unsigned NOT NULL default 0,
      `lifetime_spins` int(11) unsigned NOT NULL default 0,
      `salt_value` varchar(32), -- expectant 128bit SHA-256 salt as a 32-char hex
      PRIMARY KEY (`player_id`)
    ) Engine=InnoDB;

    INSERT INTO `player` (`player_id`, `name`, `credits`, `lifetime_spins`, `salt_value`)
    VALUES
      (1, 'Bill Smith', 0, 0, 'SXAxxiym9QmjodB6JzSghJ2vy8SlJqWP'),
      (2, 'Nancy Drew', 0, 0, 'mjBCha6aCgRZ9KdUMxUckKQbYoHCawg6'),
      (3, 'Bethany Barry', 0, 0, 'Yl3KTogIw2tLW4q3KojXsQ7J6UnTI6TJ');
